Challange 3 - Book List App

For this challange, you're going to create an app that dynamically renders a list of books.

Step 1. Have a look at bookData.js to understand the structure of the data

Step 2. Create a component called "BookDetails.js" that takes a book as a prop and dynamically renders the book title in the heading and the author and year in seperate paragraphs.

Step 3. Create a component called "BookList.js" that imports the books from bookData.js and maps through this array, passing the book prop down to the BookDetails component and rendering it. Don't forget each component needs a unique key prop.

Step 4. Import BookList into your App.js and render it.

Step 5. Start your development server and you should have a list of books on the screen.
